**BOP (Best Optimization Plugin)** is a fork of [MOP (Modern Optimization Plugin)](https://github.com/Athlon007/MOP) by Athlon007 and the ultimate performance enhancing project for My Summer Car. Quickly and easily improve FPS of MSC!

The **only** mod that improves framerate seamlessly - without user having to do any configuration, pressing buttons, or any other magic tricks! Just install the mod and it's ready to go.
